We can see 79% of the precipitation as 0. Though  Lombardy and Veneto regions generally has  Mediterranean climate
it is possible that precipitation can be zero in summer months. We have date column and this can be used to crosscheck.
Summer months generally starts from June 1st and ends on August 31st. We can do time series analysis for this

We can see 9% zeros for CloudFraction. Need to check which other feature is collinear with it.

--------------

41% of NO2_trop is null. We can solve 25% of it as NO2_strat+NO2_trop=NO2_total


--------------------------


GT_NO2 vs LAT:- Highest concentrations appear around 45.4-45.6 degrees latitude.Suggests geographical hotspots of NO2 pollution.

GT_NO2 vs LON:- Highest concentrations appear around 9.0-9.4 degrees longitude. suggests geographical hotspots of NO2 pollution.

We will create heat maps or contour plots using LAT and LON data to visualize NO2 hotspots.
Crosscheck using  spatial clustering algorithms to identify areas of high NO2 concentration.
      
GT_NO2 vs Precipitation:- Variability is high .We can see GT_NO2 decreasing with increasing precipitation.

GT_NO2 vs LST:- There's a clear diurnal pattern in GT_NO2 concentrations against LST as 
      LST directly represents time of day.Will investigate this with dates.

GT_NO2 vs AAI: This is also showing same pattern as GT_NO2 vs LST: They may be correlated with each other.

GT_NO2 vs NO2_strat:-GT_NO2 is decreasing with increasigng NO2_strat. The variability also decreases.

GT_NO2 vs NO2_total:- We can see a possitive correlation between GT_NO2 and NO2_total.The density of points decreases as both variables increase.

GT_NO2 vs NO2_Trop:- We can see a possitive correlation between GT_NO2 and NO2_Trop

GT_NO2 vs CloudFraction:- As cloud fraction increases, the maximum NO2 concentrations tend to decrease.
      The variability in NO2 seems to decrease as cloud fraction increases.

GT_NO2 vs TropopausePressure:- The relationship isn't linear.We will see if we can convert it into catgorical
    as I can see groups in the plot.

#LST  and NO2_strat are showing strong +ve correlative of 0.823390. Null values in LST: 46 % and NO2_strat: 15%. We will see if we can use this col to fill up LST maybe??
#NO2_total  and   NO2_trop are showing strong +ve correlation of 0.986797. Null values in NO2_total: 15% and NO2_trop: 41%.We will see if we can use this col to fill up  NO2_trop.


#We did the following transformations till  now
1) Filled 25% null in NO2_trop doing NO2_TOTAL minus NO2_STRAT
2) Did log transform in LST, NO2_STRAT, GT_NO2. As NO2_STRAT had very small values we did ['NO2_strat'] * 1e6 then did log for this col. 
 Null values in LST: 46 % and NO2_strat: 15%. So we will fill around 30% of missing values in LST using linear regssion on these log transformed cols.
'''
3) Did harvesine distance and k means for latitude and longitude to convert into clusters.Created cluster-7
4)Converted clusters created in 3) to dummy encoding.
